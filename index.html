                  <h5>Executive Summary</h5>
                  <p>Our sample analyses show that a blossoming company like Sylt Fish Specialties can
                    scale profits using clever analysis of daily business. Being able to monitor company
                    
                    metrics in an efficient and cost-effective manner such as this is the most advantageous way to increase profits. When the company wants to know which hour to offer
                    
                    a discount on Black Cod, they can rely on the developed dashboard to understand
                    the trends as they are happening; when the concern is about supplier performance
                    
                    for seafood logistics, it is also important to have quick dashboard access to understand the data. Apache Druid and Superset were used here in tandem to reflect the
                    
                    accessibility and power of the designs; but there are many options available that are
                    up to the discretion of the client and what they are comfortable investing in. The
                    recommendation to use open-source technology as a reporting system for company
                    data is strong due to the vast open- source development support given to Apache
                    products. The versatility of using custom Python scripts to develop reports and
                    design dashboards in a framework written completely in Python (Superset) adds a
                    gained advantage to the designed system because Python knowledge is common in
                    the education path of data analysts.</p>

                    <h5>Solution</h5>
                    <p>The idea that OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is an extremely advantageous
                      system to use for business intelligence is at the heart of our design decision for this
                      business case. Apache Druid as an OLAP database and DWH is currently in use
                      by profitable companies such as eBay, Netflix, AirBnB, and Nielsen; companies that require high-level batch and real-time processing of data. </p>

            target="_blank">Forecasting Model of Rescue Drivers Using MS-TDSP</a></h4>
					<p>Case study</p>
				  </header>
            <p>Submitted for the Model Engineering module for graduate studies at IU. The task was to develop a prediction model that
            optimized the number of rescue drivers being held on standby for the Berlin Red Cross. A baseline model was
            developed, then a precise prediction model using a few different ML algorithms was proposed in the case study,
            and the benefits and implementation were discussed further in the discussion section of the paper.</p>
          <h5>Executive Summary</h5>
          
            <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/red_cross.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Berlin Red Cross rescue service (BRC) answers to emergency calls when people are in need. On any given day, there are a set amount of rescue drivers residing on standby to answer
            these calls. When rescue drivers are not able to work due to temporary illnesses, the estimated
            number of drivers needed in a day can be interchangeable. The BRC allots a flat total of 90
            standby-drivers every day; however, the HR planning department struggles with this approach since seasonal weather patterns affect employee health and allocating a flat number of standby-
            drivers often leads to having not enough or too many drivers standing by. Our firm took up the task of fixing this organizational puzzle. We used our expertise in predictive modeling to develop a solution for the BRC that leverages machine learning (ML) techniques and data science. The solution developed can hereby be utilized by the organization to monitor, refine, and predict their approach to help redistribute budget towards cost efficient business goals. </p>
          <h5>Challenge</h5> 
          <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/datasetsplit.png" alt="" /></span>The task is to develop a solution that allows the planning department to assign standby drivers
            more accurately. Accuracy, in this case, means that there is minimal amount of extra standby
            
            drivers assigned that do not get used, while there is a maximized number of days where additional standby drivers do not need to be assigned.
            
            In developing this solution, there are many variables that need to be considered. The challenge
            herein lies in the business’ ability to understand which features of the dataset will help to predict an optimal number of standby drivers in need, which features can properly account for an accurate prediction, and the total volume, value, and variety of the organization’s data.</p>
          <p>
          <h5>Solution</h5>
          <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/gui_concept.png" alt="" /></span>Our solution takes the necessary steps to clean and preprocess the accumulation of data in
              BRC’s data warehouses (DWH) before using it to train ML models that make predictions. As a
              result of the developments, the company was able to create a solution that not only predicts the
              optimal quantity of standby drivers needed on a given day, but also improved the coefficient of
              determination (R2) score from the initial baseline models’ 7.4% to over 99%, while lowering the 
              root mean squared error (RMSE) rates from 33.73 to under 0.01 (that's quite significant).</p>

                          <p>Completed as the final exam for the Business Analyst (II) module for graduate studies at IU. The task was to conceptualize and present a Data Mining strategy for a company to use against their CRM, to identify options and alternatives, while highlighting a recommended solution to the business' use case.</p>
  <h5>Concept</h5>
<p>Bring, an online grocery delivery platform that provides ultra-fast delivery of varied products to customers’ doorstep. The business model is centered around a mobile app that allows users to make
  
  orders, track deliveries, and subscribe to repetitive shipments of groceries. The advantage of this
  platform is speed, allowing users to receive deliveries in as little as 10 minutes. Fast deliveries are
  enabled by strategically placed warehouses and AI technology to guarantee freshness and quality.</p>

<h5>CRM Optimization</h5>
<p>In the grocery delivery service sector, customer satisfaction begins with a positive experience from
  using the platform; customer satisfaction should be maintained throughout the delivery process and
  
  kept even after products have been delivered. In order to focus our CRM strategy on customer retention, it is important to identify the type of customers that are using this platform in order to create a customized experience for them. To have knowledge of which user profile is more likely to keep
  
  paying for subscriptions to our service, we should divide users into separate groups for analysis. Finally, to ensure loyalty of our brand, we need to collect the right data in our CRM process and use
  
  data mining to transform that data into knowledge about our customers. Data mining technology can
  optimize our CRM systems by focusing on the following core questions: <i>How do we know which customers will churn?, How do we guarantee satisfaction in initial and subsequent uses of the platform?</i>, and <i>How do we keep customers loyal to our brand?</i></p>

                    <blockquote>
						To highlight and formalize the interconnected relationships between
						cognitive modeling (CM), software project management (SPM), and behavioral and
						cognitive science. The study builds on the existing research efforts of SPM modeling by
						extracting an interdisciplinary cognitive approach and applying it to preexisting
						conceptual models. Methods: Systematic Literature Review (SLR), text mining, clustering.
                      Key findings: CM techniques have the capacity to reproduce a wide scope of
                      cognitive processes, many of which are useful to take into consideration in the
                      modeling and simulation of human-computer interactive behavior. While there
                      exists separated bodies of research within each of the study domains, there is an
                      incongruity amongst the modeling community between the semantic distinctions
                      of cognitive and computational modeling.
                      Conclusion: There is a strong relationship between CM, SPM, HCI, and cognitive
                      science that is under-represented in current cognitive science and PM research. The
                      implementation of cognitive theories into models that replicate SPM processes is a
                      key area of future cognitive and behavioral science studies.

Often being in connection with negative physiological and psychological symptoms, stress has been shown to have adverse effects on cognitive performance and functioning that can reduce the validity and reliability of self-reported survey answers. Traits of Emotional Intelligence (EI) and high interpersonal functioning are identified as precursors to faking behavior and exaggerating one’s mental health, both of which also have negative effects on self-report scores.</blockquote>
